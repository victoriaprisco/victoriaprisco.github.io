        <h2 class="titles">KWUR</h2>
        <p>After spending two semesters maintaing a 10-year-old website that constantly had issues with usability for members of KWUR (WashU's student-run radio station) and dependencies that were constantly hitting end-of-life, I decided to scratch the old website and separate interior system and completely rebuild into one complete website that fits all of the station's needs.</p>
        <p>This website both serves as a source of information for anyone interested in KWUR and as a DJ management system. Admin members are able to record user information, like the amount of "credits" they have, and DJs are able to login and schedule their show. The website will automatically fit their show into the available time slots given their time choices, alerting them over email if there show is changed by a DJ with more credits.</p>
        <p>Users are also able to upload files and pick the page they should appear on without any code-writing or editing necessary!</p>
        <p>The site is available <a href="http://kwur.wustl.edu">here</a>, though the DJ accounts are inaccessible for the public.</p>

        <h2 class="titles">Online Office Hours</h2>
        <p>For a class at WashU (CSE437: Software Engineering Workshop), myself and two group members built an all in one stop for online office hours. We aimed to improve the current experience students have of hunting down the correct Zoom link that is buried in posts or emails online.</p>
        <p>The site takes a Myspace approach of allowing instructors -- professors or teaching assistants -- to create their own "Classroom Page" that students will see when they join their office hours. They can add and customize widgets for the page, including embedded video calls, a collaborative and real-time whiteboard, a code-sharing editor, and a text chat.</p>
        <p>Instructors are also able to personalize their room settings, which allows password-protected rooms and rooms that require a queue before joining the office hours session.</p>
        <p>I am currently working on contacting department staff at WashU to move the site to the University's servers and used internally!</p>
        <p>The site is available <a href="https://main--437ohproject.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="titles">Swiftify</h2>
        <p>In 2019, Taylor Swift announced she would be re-recording and releasing her first 6 albums in order to own her music, as the original masters were sold to a private equity firm. Ever since, fans of her music have been listening to the new versions (called Taylor's Version). This tool uses the Spotify API to filter through a user's playlists and replace the old versions of now re-recorded songs with the corresponding "Taylor's Versions".</p>
        <p>The tool is available <a href="https://victoriaprisco.github.io/swiftify">here</a>, though it does require a Spotify account to access.</p>        <div class="more-info">
