        <h2 class="titles">Swiftify</h2>
        <p>In 2019, Taylor Swift announced she would be re-recording and releasing her first 6 albums in order to own her music, as the original masters were sold to a private equity firm. Ever since, fans of her music have been listening to the new versions (called Taylor's Version). This tool uses the Spotify API to filter through a user's playlists and replace the old versions of now re-recorded songs with the corresponding "Taylor's Versions".</p>
        <p>The tool is available <a href="https://victoriaprisco.github.io/swiftify">here</a>, though it does require a Spotify account to access.</p>        <div class="more-info">
